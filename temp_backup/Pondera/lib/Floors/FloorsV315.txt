/*
Version 3.15

Created: Andrew Sielen (Drumersl/Asielen)

This system could not have been created if it wasn't for
Garthor's quasiturf, which gave me a general idea which I
then expanded on greatly, and Lummox JR for publishing the
softcode to the Move proc.

This demo is mainly to show how a system can work, if you
want to use this in your game, it should not be to hard to
implement, however, it will not be as easy as cutting and
pasting. I tried to comment everything, however, if you
feel I need to better explain something, write about it in
the Floors, forum:
	http://members.byond.com/Drumersl/forum?forum=2

As a note, this would probably be best implemented in a game
with a small single map. Think Bomberman with multiple levels
as opposed to a full rpg. This is due to how much overhead is
required to implement this.


::IMPORTANT::
Seeing as this completely rewrites the movement procs, there
are some restrictions that with a little bit of work can
be worked around with a bit of work.
To use this system:

Limits
	--The number of levels is only restricted by the invisibility variable
	so you can technically have around 80 levels, although that would become
	extremely unwieldy.

Objects

	--Objects you wish a mob to interact with and pick cannot be
	defined just under obj/(The system uses obj/item for these
	objects but this can be changed)
		This is because the elevation type is defined indirectly
		as an object (obj/elevation) having a get/drop verb defined
		for all objects you allow for the possibility of picking up
		elevations
		*See Demo

	--Any time an object is picked up from, a check using src.Fl_Get(mob/m)
	must be called.
		it should be called as such
			if src.Fl_Get(mob/m)
				//pick up code
			src = the item
			m = the mob picking it up
		*See Fl_ObjectSystem & _Demo

	--Any time an object is dropped, src.Fl_Drop(mob/m) must be called to
	ensure that an object is dropped on thr proper level.
		This should be called the same way a Fl_Get()
		*See Fl_ObjectSystem & _Demo

Invisibility
	*See Fl_MobSystem

	 --The invisibility variable can now be used
	 	HOWEVER, invisibility has to be set at 90 or above and currently there
	 	is no way to see_invisibile, it is just possible to make invisible

		To set use the mInvisible(n) proc, where n is a number between 90 and 101
		-In addition, set invisibleimage to the image you wish to be seen when 
			invisibility is set

	 --The see invisible variable can not be used

Elevations

	 --When creating turfs/elevations the elevation level, (elevel), must be
	 defined if you want to use the elevation effect, or else it will default to 1.
	 	*See Demo

	 --The ability to Enter or Exit a turf/elevation is checked by the procs
	 Chk_Enter() and Chk_Exit(). These procs check for situations that the built
	 in procs do not account for such as the elevel and directional blocking.

	 --The 'hide' variable now allows you to choose which elevations cause the
	 see_invisible proc to change and which don't
	 	hide = 1 : default value, see_invisible does change (see floors in demo)
	 	hide = 0 : see_invisible does not change (see bridges in demo)

Movement

	 --As the demo is, the main move proc and most of the other related procs are not
	 good candidates for modification. It should be good for most needs seeing as it
	 not only does elevations, but it also allows for directional blocking and control
	 over corner cutting. None of the procs in this demo call the parent proc. This could
	 cause problems if you have overwritten them in your own system. If you need to modify
	 the move system, I suggest you don't modify the code to much, and just write your own
	 proc and have it called by the proc you want to change, instead of modifying the proc
	 directly.




Updates:

Version 3.15 - 12/15/2010
-Added invisibility image which at least allows you to see yourself when invisible
	This added a variable to mob named invisibleimage, just set this to whatever you want
		and that image will be displayed when invisibility is set
Version 3.10 - 12/14/2010
-Now allows for invisibility
	HOWEVER, invisibility has to be set at 90 or above and currently there is no way to
		see_invisibile, it is just possible to make invisible
	To do use the mInvisible() proc
	-This reduces the number of possible layers to around 80, although such a high number
		would still be hard to work with

Version 3.01 - 12/13/2010
-Added text file instead of Fl_Notes.dm
Version 3.00 - 12/13/2010
-Fixed Typos in Notes
-Changed it so bridges do not affect see_invisible
	hide variable 	when set to 1 will affect see_invisible (floors)
					when set to 0 it will not (bridges)
-Added macros for get and drop (g and d)
-Updated Map file to new format
-Updated Map to showcase new features (old map is still included as the second z level of Demo.dmm)

Version 2 - 3/13/2007
-Fixed Exit Not being Called
-Made Get/Drop easier to Deal With
-Added more documentation

Version 1 - 11/1/2006
-Original Release
