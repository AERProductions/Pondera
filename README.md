xist to survive in a world of creation and destruction. Claim your own in the vast wilderness that occupies the expanse of Pondera. Gathering resources not only to live, but to thrive -- build your desires, a fishing hut, a village, even your own kingdom castles. Team up with others or go it alone to discover what path lies within your desires! The waters of Pondera may tell, while your hands set the stone.
