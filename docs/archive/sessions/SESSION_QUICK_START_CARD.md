## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well
✅ Deed system (persistence + notifications)  
✅ Farming pipeline (quality → rewards)  
✅ Rank system (progression feels good)  
✅ Cooking system (recipes work)  
✅ Build pipeline (0 errors, fast)  

### What Needs Attention
⚠️ No audio (game is silent!)  
⚠️ Limited recipe discovery paths (only 2 of 3)  
⚠️ Unused variables (5 warnings)  
⚠️ Rank system scattered (10 separate systems)  
⚠️ Admin tools incomplete (need more debug commands)  

### Opportunity Windows (High-Reward)
💎 Audio = 30% of immersion, 1-2 hours to restore  
💎 Recipes = Most engaging gameplay, 3-4 hours to add experimentation  
💎 Ranks = Foundation for future, 2-3 hours to unify
