# Kingdom of Greed: Faction System Design

## Overview

The Kingdom of Greed is not monolithic. It's divided into **4 competing factions**, each with its own:
- Leadership structure
- Recruitment criteria
- Faction quests
- Unique mechanics/abilities
- Territory control
- NPC populations
- Economic interests

Players can work for any/all factions, switching allegiances to play factions against each other.

## Faction 1: The Merchant Princes (Port of Plenty)

### **Philosophy**
"Why destroy the world when you can own it?"

Merchants who seek to **exploit the entity's power for wealth and commerce**. They view the entity as a resource to be harvested, not destroyed or worshipped. They build trade monopolies, enslave workers, and extract resources for profit.

### **Leadership**
- **Grand Merchant** (faction leader): Controls Port of Plenty, sets pricing and quotas
- **Trade Lords** (3-5): Each controls specific trade route or resource monopoly
- **Quartermaster**: Manages faction inventory, faction shop
- **Spy Master**: Intelligence network, sabotage operations

### **Territory**
- **Primary Hub**: Port of Plenty (crater rim, easiest access)
- **Secondary Bases**: Resource extraction camps (scattered across crater floor)
- **Trade Routes**: Paths to other kingdoms for black market smuggling

### **Recruitment Path**
1. "Acquire forbidden goods from other kingdoms" → Trade quest
2. "Deliver contraband to Port of Plenty" → Economics quest
3. "Convince NPC to work as slave" → Morality test (evil path)
4. "Enforce labor contract on escapee" → Dark quest
5. "Rise to Trade Lord rank" → Leadership position

### **Faction Mechanics**

#### **Faction Shop**
- Black market items unavailable elsewhere
- Exotic goods from other continents
- Stolen magical artifacts
- Forbidden recipes (exploitation-focused)
- Higher prices than legitimate merchants
- Accepts stolen goods as currency

#### **Economic Quests**
- "Undercut merchant X's pricing" (market sabotage)
- "Acquire N units of [resource]" (harvest quests)
- "Deliver goods to Port of Plenty" (trading runs)
- "Establish new trade route" (exploration + negotiation)
- "Buy out competitor" (economic warfare)

#### **Faction Abilities**
- Discount prices in faction shops (loyalty reward)
- Access to smuggling routes (quick travel)
- Ability to hire mercenaries (faction NPCs as allies)
- Black market trading (sell stolen goods)
- Price manipulation (corner markets)

#### **Faction Reputation**
- **+25**: Merchant recognizes you, small discount (5%)
- **+50**: Trade Lord status, medium discount (15%), access to faction quests
- **+75**: Regional merchant, large discount (25%), can hire faction mercenaries
- **+100**: Merchant Prince, major discount (40%), command faction operations

### **Conflicts With Other Factions**
- **vs. Rebels**: Economic sabotage, targeted slavery recruitment
- **vs. Corrupted**: Competing for entity power access
- **vs. Conquerors**: Military threat to trade routes, resource competition

### **Unique Items**
- Black Market Key (access to hidden shops)
- Merchant's License (trading discounts)
- Smuggler's Map (quick routes between kingdoms)
- Entity-Touched Ledger (tracking faction operations)

## Faction 2: The Corrupted (Entity Cultists)

### **Philosophy**
"The entity is divine. We must commune with it, serve it, become one with it."

Religious cultists who view the entity as a **god or transcendent being** worthy of worship. They perform rituals, seek to deepen their connection to entity power, and believe corruption is spiritual enlightenment.

### **Leadership**
- **High Priest** (faction leader): Direct entity conduit, most corrupted
- **Ritual Masters** (3-5): Lead corruption ceremonies, teach dark magic
- **Cultists** (many): Devoted followers seeking transformation

### **Territory**

### **Recruitment Path**
1. "Attend entity communion ritual" → Immersion quest

4. "Recruit others to the faith" → Proselytization quest

### **Faction Mechanics**

### **Unique Items**
- Corruption Catalyst (speeds up corruption transformation)

## Multi-Faction Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Working For All Factions**
- Possible but dangerous (discovered agents are assassinated)
- Requires careful reputation management
- High reward for coordination (play factions against each other)
- Risk: If caught, massive reputation losses with all factions

### **Scenario 2: Faction Civil War**
- If player rises to leadership in multiple factions (very hard)
- Factions may declare war on each other
- Can escalate to territory battles
- Player's choice determines winner

### **Scenario 3: Faction Defection**
- Join Faction A, then switch to Faction B
- A marks you as traitor (reputation loss, assassination attempts)
- B gains insider knowledge (provides advantage)
- Creates dynamic where player is constantly hunted

### **Scenario 4: Liberation Through Rebellion**
- Hero: Works exclusively with Rebels, rises to leadership
- Leads major liberation movement
- Raids extraction camps, frees thousands
- Rebellion grows into alternative power structure

### **Scenario 5: Conquest Through Villainry**

---

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Faction Quests**: Design at least 20 quests per faction, varying difficulty
2. **NPC Density**: Each faction needs 10-15 NPCs (leaders, merchants, quest givers)
3. **Reputation Thresholds**: Use thresholds to unlock quests/content (like 25, 50, 75, 100)
4. **Faction Conflict**: When player joins one faction, others become slightly hostile
5. **Defection Costs**: Switching factions should come with reputation penalties and (potentially) assassination attempts
6. **Endings**: Each faction should have an ending tied to player choices
7. **Hidden Faction Path**: Consider secret fifth faction (hybrid/neutral path) for advanced players
8. **PvP Integration**: Factions war in PvP continent (separate from story mode)
