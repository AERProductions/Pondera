/**
 * Spells.dm - ARCHIVED LEGACY CODE
 * 
 * This file contained the original spell/magic system from early Pondera development.
 * 
 * Status: DEPRECATED (Replaced by CombatSystem.dm)
 * Reason: Full combat system redesign in Phase 10
 * 
 * Original Features (no longer used):
 * - Chain Lightning, Cascade Lightning, Heat Storm spells
 * - Ice Storm, Shard Burst, Water Shock effects
 * - Acid, Vitae healing spells
 * - Mana healing, Abjure, Rephase, Toxin spells
 * - Cosmos spell effect
 * 
 * Migration: All combat magic is now handled by UnifiedAttackSystem.dm
 * and is integrated with the continent-aware combat system.
 * 
 * For historical reference, the original file (2200+ lines) is preserved in:
 * - Git history (git log -p -- dm/Spells.dm)
 * - docs/archive/systems/ (archived documentation)
 * 
 * If you need to restore any functionality, see:
 * - CombatSystem.dm for attack resolution
 * - WeaponAnimationSystem.dm for attack effects
 * - AudioIntegrationSystem.dm for spell sounds

// This file is intentionally minimal as a marker.
// All spell code has been removed (see git history for full implementation).
// Modern combat system is in UnifiedAttackSystem.dm and CombatSystem.dm
