## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Starting Work
```
1. Open VS Code
2. Run: obsidian_brain search for topic
3. Check: memory_bank_show_memory("activeContext.md")
4. Review: Most recent Session-Log
5. Reference: Appropriate guide from vault
```

### During Work
```
1. Refer to Code Patterns for similar implementations
2. Check Developer Guide for integration steps
3. Verify with Build System Reference before compiling
4. Reference Architecture Decisions if questioning design
```

### Finishing Work
```
1. Create new Session-Log-YYYY-MM-DD.md
2. Document what was done and learned
3. Update memory_bank_update_progress()
4. Add new ADRs if major decisions made
```
