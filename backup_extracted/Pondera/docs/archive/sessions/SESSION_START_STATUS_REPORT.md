## 🎬 HOW TO PROCEED

### Step 1: Choose Your Path
- Ready to engage players? → **Path A**
- Want solid foundation? → **Path B**
- Want balanced impact? → **Path C**

### Step 2: Start Work
```powsh
# Commit current state
git add -A
git commit -m "Health check complete: 0 errors, ready for primary work"

# Pick first win and implement
# Example: Start with WIN #1 (fix warnings)
```

### Step 3: Build & Verify After Each Win
```pwsh
# Build to verify no regressions
# Test feature in-game
# Document what you did
# Move to next win
```

### Step 4: Commit When Milestone Complete

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

**Need to understand a system?**
- Start with `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (comprehensive)
- Then read relevant phase file (e.g., `PHASE_46_48_HYBRID_INTEGRATION.md`)

**Need to add a feature?**
- Check integration points in win description
- Update .dme include order if adding new file
- Test after each change

**Need to debug?**
- Build and check for errors
- Use admin commands (WIN #9) to test states
- Check world logs in terminal

**Stuck?**
- Read relevant documentation first (usually has answers)
- Check similar systems for patterns
- Ask yourself: "Did I update character_data persistence?"
