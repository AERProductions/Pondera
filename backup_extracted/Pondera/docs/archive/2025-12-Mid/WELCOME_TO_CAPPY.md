## 🚀 What Cappy Does

Cappy is the **integrated filesystem tool** that gives you:

✅ **File Reading** - Fast, with head/tail for large files  
✅ **Parallel Reads** - Read multiple files at once  
✅ **File Writing** - Create and overwrite files  
✅ **File Moving** - Rename or archive files  
✅ **Directory Operations** - List, tree structure, creation  
✅ **File Discovery** - Search by glob patterns  
✅ **Metadata** - Get file info (size, dates, etc.)  
✅ **No External Tools** - Built-in, always available  

---

## 🎓 Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Check Your Build
```powershell
# Get build artifact info
integrated_filesystem(get_file_info, c:\...\Pondera.dmb)

# Result: 3.07 MB, last modified today ✅
```

### Example 2: Understand Project Structure
```powershell
# See complete vault structure
integrated_filesystem(directory_tree, c:\...\obsidian-vault)

# Result: Full nested JSON tree ✅
```

### Example 3: Find Session Logs
```powershell
# Find all session documentation
integrated_filesystem(search_files, path=..., pattern=Session-Log*.md)

# Result: All session log paths ✅
```

### Example 4: Read Multiple Files Parallel
```powershell
# Read multiple related files at once
integrated_filesystem(read_multiple_files, 
  paths=[HUDManager.dm, LoginGateway.dm, CharacterCreationGUI.dm])

# Result: All 3 files read simultaneously ✅
```

### Example 5: Archive Old Documentation
```powershell
# Move file to archive
integrated_filesystem(move_file, 
  source=OLD_DOC.md, destination=archive/OLD_DOC.md)

# Result: File moved and organized ✅
```

## 🔄 How It Fits In

### Your Workflow Now Looks Like:

```
1. FIND CODE
   ├─ search_files (Cappy) or grep_search
   
2. READ & UNDERSTAND
   ├─ read_file(head=50) or read_multiple_files (Cappy)
   ├─ grep_search for specific patterns
   └─ semantic_search for context
   
3. CHECK DESIGN
   ├─ obsidian_brain for architecture decisions
   ├─ memory_bank for current context
   └─ chat_history for past solutions
   
4. MAKE CHANGES
   ├─ write_file (Cappy) for new code
   ├─ replace_string_in_file for edits
   └─ move_file (Cappy) for organizing
   
5. VERIFY & DOCUMENT
   ├─ directory_tree (Cappy) to check structure
   ├─ get_file_info (Cappy) to verify output
   ├─ memory_bank to track progress
   └─ obsidian_brain to document findings
```

**Everything is built-in. No external tools needed.**

## 💡 Why Cappy Changes Everything

### Before Cappy (Limitations)
```
❌ File operations required external tools
❌ Could only read one file at a time
❌ Couldn't see full directory structure
❌ No metadata about files
❌ File organization manual
```

### After Cappy (Complete)
```
✅ All file operations in VS Code
✅ Parallel reads for speed
✅ Full directory trees instantly
✅ Instant file metadata
✅ Organize and archive easily
```

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Investigating Bug
```
1. search_files(pattern="*.dm") to find code
2. read_file(found_file, head=50) to preview
3. grep_search to find exact issue
4. read_multiple_files on related files
5. directory_tree to understand structure
6. replace_string_in_file to fix
7. obsidian_brain to document
```

### Scenario 2: Code Review
```
1. directory_tree to see all files
2. search_files(pattern="*.dm") to find files
3. read_multiple_files to read all changes
4. grep_search for specific patterns
5. move_file to archive reviewed code
```

### Scenario 3: Project Reorganization
```
1. directory_tree to see structure
2. search_files to find files
3. create_directory for new folders
4. move_file to reorganize
5. write_file for new documentation
```

### Scenario 4: Documentation Update
```
1. search_files(pattern="*.md") to find docs
2. read_multiple_files to see current state
3. write_file or replace_string to update
4. directory_tree to verify structure
5. obsidian_brain to store updated docs
```
